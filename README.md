# Python-Project-Accident-dataset
This project focuses on analysing an accident dataset to explore various factors contributing to accidents and predict accident severity using machine learning models.
A brief overview of the steps taken in this project:
1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes various preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, outlier detection and treatment, and encoding categorical variables.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization techniques like box plots, scatter plots, and pair plots are used to understand the distribution of numerical features and detect any patterns or anomalies.
3. Feature Selection and Engineering: Features are selected based on their correlation with the target variable (Accident Severity), and new features are engineered to improve the model's performance.
4. Model Building: Different machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression are applied. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to find the best model parameters.
5. Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score. Confusion matrices and ROC curves are plotted to visualize the performance.
6. Model Interpretation: Techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) are used to interpret the model's predictions and understand the influence of various features.
